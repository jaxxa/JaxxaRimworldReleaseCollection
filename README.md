# Install Instructions
The easiest way to install a mod is usually using Steam Workshop.
Although installing manually needs to be used with non-steam versions and can be used with steam versions to prevent automatic updates. 


#Maunal Install Instructions

 * Goto the GitHub page of the mod that you want to Download in the above table.
 * Goto the Release section
 * Download the Version that you want, taking care to Download the Release version (The one that has a version Number), and not one of the source files.
 * Extract the Files to your Download Location.
 * Goto your Rimworld Folder. 
   * If you installed manually it will be where you launch the .exe from.
   * For Steam it will be "\steamapps\common\RimWorld", if you cant find it:
     * In Steam you can Right Click on Rimworld
	 * Select Properties
	 * Goto the "Local Files" tab
	 * Click "Browse Local Files"
	 * A window should open to the correct location.
 * Enter the "Mods" subfolder
   * You should see "Core" and any other mods you maually installed
 * Copy the Folder for my mod into the "Mods" folder.
   * The path should be "RimWorld\Mods\{ModName}\About"
 * Run Rimworld
 * Activate the Mod

 
#Update Notifications

The Changelog of this file also lists the most recent updates.

The most recent versions of my mods should all support other mods being used to notify of updates.
This can be helpful for keeping uptodate when using the manually installed versions.


# Backup Downloads

Alternitivly to downloading from the specific Github pages this Reposotory contains the release .zip files of the mods in a single location.
